Complete coverage of the Human Genome U133 Set plus 6,500 additional genes for analysis of over 47,000 transcripts
All probe sets represented on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Set are identically replicated on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The sequences from which these probe sets were derived were selected from GenBankÂ®, dbEST, and RefSeq. The sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 133, April 20, 2001) and then refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the University of California, Santa Cruz Golden-Path human genome database (April 2001 release).
In addition, there are 9,921 new probe sets representing approximately 6,500 new genes. These gene sequences were selected from GenBank, dbEST, and RefSeq. Sequence clusters were created from the UniGene database (Build 159, January 25, 2003) and refined by analysis and comparison with a number of other publicly available databases, including the Washington University EST trace repository and the NCBI human genome assembly (Build 31).

SAMPLE 1
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

SAMPLE 3
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

Total RNA was isolated from endometrial tissue using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturerâs instructions, followed by DNase treatment and purification with Qiagen RNeasy Plus Kit. The purity and quality of the RNA were assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. First and second strand cDNAs were prepared according to the Affymetrix microarray preparation protocol (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

    <Data-Processing>
We imported all of the microarray data files into R and normalized them simultaneously. The normalization procedure consists of two steps executed with programs in the Bioconductor package GCRMA. First, we compute the probe affinities using the annotation file hgu133plus2cdf. Second, we normalize the data by setting two options and leaving the rest at default values. The affinity.info option is set to use the probe affinities computed in the first step. The type option is set to fullmodel which uses both the sequence information and mismatch probe model.

    <Title>Molecular Classification of Endometriosis and Disease Stage Using High-Dimensional Genomic Data</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE51981</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>25243856</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Endometriosis, an estrogen-dependent, progesterone-resistant, inflammatory disorder affects 10% of reproductive-age women. It is diagnosed and staged at surgery, resulting in an 11-year latency from symptom onset to diagnosis, underscoring the need for less invasive, less expensive approaches. Since the uterine lining (endometrium) in women with endometriosis has altered molecular profiles, we tested whether molecular classification of this tissue can distinguish and stage disease. We developed classifiers using genomic data from n=148 archived endometrial samples from women with endometriosis or without endometriosis (normal controls or with other common uterine/pelvic pathologies) across the menstrual cycle and evaluated their performance on independent sample sets.  Classifiers were trained separately on samples in specific hormonal milieu, using margin tree classification, and accuracies were scored on independent validation samples. Classification of samples from women with endometriosis or no endometriosis involved two binary decisions each based on expression of specific genes. These first distinguished presence or absence of uterine/pelvic pathology and then no endometriosis from endometriosis, with the latter further classified according to severity (minimal/mild or moderate/severe). Best performing classifiers identified endometriosis with 90-100% accuracy, were cycle phase-specific or independent, and utilized relatively few genes to determine disease and severity. Differential gene expression and pathway analyses revealed immune activation, altered steroid and thyroid hormone signaling/metabolism and growth factor signaling in endometrium of women with endometriosis. Similar findings were observed with other disorders versus controls. Thus, classifier analysis of genomic data from endometrium can detect and stage pelvic endometriosis with high accuracy, dependent or independent of hormonal milieu. We propose that limited classifier candidate-genes are of high value in developing diagnostics and identifying therapeutic targets. Discovery of endometrial molecular differences in the presence of endometriosis and other uterine/pelvic pathologies raises the broader biological question of their impact on the steroid hormone response and normal functions of this tissue.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
We analyzed endometrial samples from n=148 women without or with endometriosis and/or other uterine/pelvic pathologies, using whole genome microarrays.
